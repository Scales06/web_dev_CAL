        <h1>About Sofia Martinez</h1>
        <p>Hello, My name is Sofia Martinez. I am a HUGE ANIME FANATIC, hence why I am here to talk about why I have decided to open a storefront, an anime storefront to be exact.
            As expected , I am an anime fanatic so it only makes sense why I would decide to open up an anime storefront.In my storefront, there will be plentiful content to meet the standards 
        of visitors who are keen to explore this storefront, for example, a section all about the products I will put up for sale, events and any upcoming events or customer recommendations in which 
    will contain numerous amounts of support for the visitors.</p>

    <h1>Our inspiration</h1>
