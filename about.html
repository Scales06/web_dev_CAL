        <h1><u>About Sofia Martinez</u></h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sofia Martinez and I am a HUGE ANIME FANATIC, hence why I am here to talk about why I have decided to open a storefront, an anime storefront to be exact.
        </p>
        <p>
            As expected I am an anime fanatic so it only makes sense why I would decide to open up an anime storefront.<br> In this storefront, there will be plentiful content to meet the standards 
            of visitors who are keen to explore this storefront. <br>For example:<ol>
                <li>Products and Information Sector</li>
                <li>Customer FAQ</li>
                <li>Events and Upcoming Events</li>
                <li>Offers and Discounts</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    
        <h1><u>Our inspiration</u></h1>
        <p>The idea behind the storefront is influenced by various other websites in which involves anime, as such as <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/"> Crunchyroll</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://forbiddenplanet.com/"> Forbidden Planet</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/updates"> Shueisha</a></li>
        </ul> </p>
    <p>These anime related storefronts and websites brought inspiration to me, who once was a fan who enjoys anime now creating their own storefront from
        scratch with the aid of other quality programmers. <br> With this storefront , I hope that I can inspire others to create their own ideal storefronts too.
