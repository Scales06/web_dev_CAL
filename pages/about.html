            <h2><u>About me - Sofia Martinez</u></h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Sofia Martinez and I am a HUGE ANIME FANATIC, 
            <br>hence why I'm going to talk about why I have decided to open a storefront, an anime storefront to be exact.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I said before, I absolutely LOVE ANIME, and so it only makes sense that I'd open up my own anime shop.
                <br>My hope with this website is to spread the joy of anime to newcomers and anime veterans alike!
            </p>

            <p>  
                On my website, there will be lots of content to meet the expectations 
                of anime fans such as myself. <br>For example:
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li>Products and Information Sector</li>
                <li>Customer FAQ</li>
                <li>Events and Upcoming Events</li>
                <li>Offers and Discounts</li>
            </ol>
        </article>

        <article>
            <h2><u>My inspirations</u></h2>
            <p>The idea behind this storefront is influenced by various other websites, such as </p>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/"> Crunchyroll</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://forbiddenplanet.com/"> Forbidden Planet</a></li>
                    <li><a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/updates"> Shueisha</a></li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>
                These anime websites and shops brought inspiration to me
                - who once was a fan that enjoyed watching anime in the comfort of their home <br>
                - and now is the proud creator and owner of an entire anime storefront! <br>
                <br> Of course, I didn't do this alone. Through the help of talented programmers,
                I brought my idea to life! <br> With this storefront, I hope that I can inspire others to create their own ideal websites too!
