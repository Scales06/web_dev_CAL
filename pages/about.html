        <h1><u>About Sofia Martinez</u></h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Sofia Martinez and I am a HUGE ANIME FANATIC, 
            <br>hence why I'm going to talk about why I have decided to open a storefront, an anime storefront to be exact.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I said before, I absolutely LOVE ANIME, and so it only makes sense that I'd open up my own anime shop.
            <br>My hope with this website is to spread the joy of anime to newcomers and anime veterans alike!
        </p>
        <p>  
            On my website, there will be lots of content to meet the expectations 
            of anime fans such as myself. <br>For example:
        </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Products and Information Sector</li>
                <li>Customer FAQ</li>
                <li>Events and Upcoming Events</li>
                <li>Offers and Discounts</li>
            </ol>
        
    
        <h1><u>My inspirations</u></h1>
        <p>The idea behind this storefront is influenced by various other websites, such as <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/"> Crunchyroll</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://forbiddenplanet.com/"> Forbidden Planet</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://mangaplus.shueisha.co.jp/updates"> Shueisha</a></li>
        </ul> </p>
    <p>
        These anime websites and shops brought inspiration to me
         - who once was a fan that enjoyed watching anime in the comfort of their home <br>
          - and now is the proud creator and owner of an entire anime storefront! <br>
          <br> Of course, I didn't do this alone. Through the help of talented programmers,
          I brought my idea to life! <br> With this storefront, I hope that I can inspire others to create their own ideal websites too!
